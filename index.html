      Somewhere between late nights and quiet mornings,  
      <span class="highlight">baby boy</span> learned how to care better.
    </p>

    <p>
      And <span class="highlight">baby girl</span>—  
      with her calm strength—  
      made it feel safe to stay.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m still a <span class="highlight">puppy</span> sometimes.  
      Learning. Trying. Showing up.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Love hurts but we power through.</em>  
      Not loudly.  
      Just… <span class="highlight">together</span>.

      Tea cooling by the window.  
      Simit crumbs on the table.  
      Baklava sweetness lingering.

      Istanbul evenings.  
      The Bosphorus breathing slow.  
      Lights reflecting—never still.

      Some lyrics don’t need to be named.  
      They sit between lines.  
      Like a song we both hear differently—
      and still understand.
